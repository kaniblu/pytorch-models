# PyTorch Helper Tools for Models #

This thin wrapper allows models (or more specifically their configurations) 
to be loaded from yaml files. It also promotes easier modularization by separating
high-level hyperparameters (word dimensions) and module-specific hyperparameters (number of hidden layers etc.). Examples can be found in to `tests` folder.

Install this package through pip: `pip install pytorch-models`
